<h2>99 Bottles of Beer on the wall</h2>
<p>Your task is to create a function recite that takes two integers as parameters, start which is the initial number of
bottles of beer on the wall and take which is the number of bottles taken. The function will
return a list of strings which are the lines for the song. There should be a blank line between verses. <br>
For example recite(5,2) would return<br>
    <code>['5 bottles of beer on the wall, 5 bottles of beer.', 'Take one down and pass it around, 4 bottles of beer on the wall.', '', '4 bottles of beer on the wall, 4 bottles of beer.', 'Take one down and pass it around, 3 bottles of beer on the wall.'] </code> </p>
<p>Your function should produce the following lines for 1 and 0 and any other number n bottles of beer </p>
<h3>1 bottle</h3>
<p>1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.<br>
Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.</p>
<h3>0 bottles </h3>
<p>No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. <br>
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.</p>
<h3>n bottles</h3>
<p>n bottles of beer on the wall, n bottles of beer.<br>
Take one down and pass it around, n-1 bottles of beer on the wall.</p>
<p>The printed output of recite(5,6) is as follows, the code under the function will display this</p>
