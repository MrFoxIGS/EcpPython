<h2>DNA Hamming Distance</h2>
<p>In computer science the hamming distance counts the number of differences between
2 sequences that have the same length. We can apply this idea to see how similar 2 strands of DNA are.</p>
<p>You will need to create a function distance that has 2 strings parameters strand_a and strand_b.
The function will return an integer which the hamming distance between strand_a and strand_b</p>
<p>e.g. distance('GTTAC','CTTAG') will return 2</p>
<p>The function has a pre built Value Error if the user tries to input strings of differing lengths</p>
