<h2>Squares</h2>
<p>In this task you will be writing 3 functions and using functions within other functions</p>
<h3>Square of sum</h3>
<p>This function has a parameter of an integer - number
and returns an integer that is the square of
the sum of all the integers up to number<br>
e.g. square_of_sum(3) will return 36, (1+2+3)^2</p>
<h3>Sum of sqaures</h3>
<p>The function has a parameter of an integer -number and returns an integer that is the sum of all of the square numbers
up to number<br>
e.g. sum_of_squares(3) will return 14, 1^2+4^2+9^2 </p>
<h3>Difference of squares</h3>
<p>The final function has a parameter of an integer - number and will return the difference between
the functions square_of_sums(number) and sum_of_squares(number)<br>
e.g. difference_of_squares(3) returns 22, 36-14</p>
