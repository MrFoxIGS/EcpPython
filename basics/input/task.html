<h2>input function</h2>
<p>The input function allows the user to input data (duh). The program will pause until the user presses [enter]. You need to store the input in a variable. User input is stored as a string.</p>
<p>The syntax is as follows:<br>
<code>VariableName = input("prompt")</code><br>
You can use the data from the user later in your code by using the variable name, data can be overwritten in variables e.g. <br>
</p>
<h2>String Concatenation</h2>
<p>Strings (sequence of characters) can be concatenated (joined) by the + sign <br>
</p>
<p>Have a play with the code to see how input, variables and string concatenation works</p>
